# Getting Started

To get started with this roadmap, you should have a basic understanding of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. If you're not familiar with these languages, you can start by learning the basics. 

There are many resources available online to help you learn these languages, including:

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

> **Once you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can start learning more advanced topics.**

# Roadmap
## - Front-End Development
The first step in the roadmap is to learn front-end development. This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other front-end technologies. The following topics should be covered:

<ins>**Resources :**</ins>
#### *Basic :*
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

#### *Advanced :*
- [ReactJs](https://react.dev/)
- [AngularJs](https://angular.io/docs)
- [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/)

## - Back-End Development
The next step in the roadmap is to learn back-end development. This includes server-side programming languages, databases, and other back-end technologies. The following topics should be covered:

- Server-Side Languages (e.g. Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby)
- Web Frameworks (e.g. Django, etc)
- Web Servers (e.g. Apache, Nginx)

## - Databases

Databases are an essential component of web development, allowing for the storage and retrieval of data. Some of the key skills and technologies you should learn for databases include:

- Relational Databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- NoSQL Databases (e.g. MongoDB, etc)
- SQL
- Database Design and Modeling

## - APIs and Web Services

APIs and web services are used to facilitate communication between different parts of a web application, as well as between different web applications. Some of the key skills and technologies you should learn for APIs and web services include:

- RESTful APIs
- GraphQL
- API Design and Documentation
- Authentication and Authorization

## - Deployment and Hosting

Deployment and hosting are essential components of web development, allowing you to make your web application available to users. Some of the key skills and technologies you should learn for deployment and hosting include:

- DevOps Tools (e.g. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/))
- Cloud Hosting (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure)

## - Conclusion

This roadmap is by no means exhaustive, but it should provide you with a good starting point for your web development journey. Remember that web development is a constantly evolving field and as a web developer you should always be ready to learn new things as they come your way. 

**Happy learning!!**
